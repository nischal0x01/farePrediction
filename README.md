# Uber Fare Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Uber fare prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as pickup and dropoff locations, trip distance, time of day, and passenger count, we've developed a model to estimate fare prices accurately.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn lightgbm
```

## Dataset
The project uses the Uber Fare dataset, which includes the following key features:
- Pickup and dropoff coordinates
- Pickup datetime
- Passenger count
- Fare amount

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (e.g., distance calculation, time of day categorization)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Machine Learning models:
  - Linear Regression (baseline)
  - LightGBM (advanced model)
- Feature importance analysis
- Prediction on new data

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and converted datatypes.
2. Feature Engineering: Created new features like 'distance' and 'time_of_day'.
3. EDA: Visualized correlations and distributions.
4. Model Development: Implemented and compared Linear Regression and LightGBM models.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV for LightGBM optimization.
6. Evaluation: Assessed models using MSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.

## Results
- The LightGBM model outperformed the Linear Regression baseline.
- Key factors influencing fare prices: trip distance, time of day, and location.
- Model achieved an R-squared score of [Insert your R-squared score here].
